# Goodreads
Tableau Desktop

I have been a Goodreads user since 2020 during Covid time, using it to keep track of the books that I have read and the dates between which I read them.

You can export your own Goodreads data to replicate my methodology by following [these steps](https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/How-do-I-import-or-export-my-books-1553870934590).

## Methodology
The wrangling and cleaning of the dataset was performed using Pythonâ€™s pandas library.
The visualisation was performed using Tableau.

## Outputs
The completed Tableau dashboard can be found on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sam.gormley#!/vizhome/goodreads_16153181076770/Goodreads).
A screenshot of the dashboard is also located in this repository [here](goodreads.png).
