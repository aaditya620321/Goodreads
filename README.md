# Goodreads DashBoard

## Motivation

This project’s motivation was to visualise trends in my reading history and habits.

I have been a Goodreads user since 2019, using it to keep track of the books that I have read and the dates between which I read them.

## Methodology
The wrangling and cleaning of the dataset was performed using Python’s pandas library.
The visualisation was performed using Tableau.
